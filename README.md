# Pokedex

This project was my first "large" web application project. The idea behind it is to create a web application that is responsive based off screen size and uses Server Side Generation and Statically Generated Pages to display basic data from Pokemon games using the PokeAPI.

## Main Page

(SSG) This page displays all of the pokedexs and provides a basic description of that pokedex. The images author credits is at the bottom of the page.

## Pokemon List

(SSG) This page displays all of the unique pokemon to that regions Pokedex.

## Individual Pokemon Details

(SSR) This page displays basic data from the PokeAPI. I created custom badges as the API just displays the word of the type.
